When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to collaborate, or want to be location/machine agnostic and use a centralized place for all commits

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not need all the changes, since they may be part of a bigger project and keeping everythingin sync is wasting a lot of bandwidth. Also, you might not have permissions.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used to create a copy of a repository on Github only, nothing is copied locally. Whereas a clone would copy the repository from github to your local machine. A branch just creates a snapshot of a repository (non-linear) so you could work off different features.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can now work offline and understand what changes were made to the master.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

It would require a tremendous amount of co-ordination and sending files back and forth. Would be much harder.
