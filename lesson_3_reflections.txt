When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to collaborate, or want to be location/machine agnostic and use a centralized place for all commits

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not need all the changes, since they may be part of a bigger project and keeping everythingin sync is wasting a lot of bandwidth. Also, you might not have permissions.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used to create a copy of a repository on Github only, nothing is copied locally. Whereas a clone would copy the repository from github to your local machine. A branch just creates a snapshot of a repository (non-linear) so you could work off different features.
