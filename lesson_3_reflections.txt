When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to collaborate, or want to be location/machine agnostic and use a centralized place for all commits

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not need all the changes, since they may be part of a bigger project and keeping everythingin sync is wasting a lot of bandwidth. Also, you might not have permissions.
